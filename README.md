# VA V.A.U.L.T. – Veteran Archive Utility for Legal & Timeline-Building

**V.A.U.L.T.** is an open-source toolkit designed to help veterans audit, analyze, and extract meaningful data from decades of personal VA medical and service records—especially when dumped as a massive PDF or CD archive.

## Mission
To give veterans the tools to:
- Understand their own medical/service history
- Build structured timelines for claims and appeals
- Surface errors, omissions, or contradictions in VA documentation
- Empower advocacy, legal support, and personal health understanding

## Early Goals
- Parse large VA-provided PDFs
- OCR scanned records
- Extract conditions, diagnoses, prescriptions, and timestamps
- Build a case timeline from extracted data
- Offer summaries using local AI (e.g., Notes LLM) or GPT-4 via a secure wrapper

## Current Status
Project scaffold is live. Initial modules being developed:
- `extract_cd_contents.sh`
- `pdf_splitter.py`
- `notes_parser.py`
- `gpt_summary_wrapper.py`

## Want to Help?
We’re seeking:
- Python developers
- Veterans with experience navigating VA records
- People who understand clinical language, NLP, or OCR pipelines
- Anyone who gives a damn about fixing this broken data flow

Reach out via Issues or submit a PR. This toolkit will be freely shared with the veteran community and is designed to be privacy-conscious and locally runnable.
